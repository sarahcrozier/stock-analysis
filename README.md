# **Stock-Analysis**
## **Overview**
The client requested an analysis of stocks to assist his parents in making investment decisions based on a group of stocks labled as "green stocks". The analysis report was created in Excel using Visual Basic Application (VBA). Initially the analysis focused on the stock DQ, which was the stock that clients parents had orininally invested in. The anyalsis was continued on an additional group of stocks in the "green stocks" catagory. In total 11 stocks were analyzed for volume, starting price and ending price, to determine if there would be a positive or negative investment return. 

## **Results**
- Stock-anaylsis Results
The stock analysis tool assisted the client in determining the return on "green stock" investment. The 2017 year showed a positive return for the DQ stock and all but one of the other options. The 2018 year had nearly all of the stocks showing losses. In order, to make a more informed decision the client could use this tool, loading more recent data to determine a more long term trend. 

- Code Refoctoring Preformance
The intial code returned a slower run time. By refactoring the code the run times decreased and the efficency was improved.

## **Summary**
- Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
Code refactoring is an important part of data analysis and code development. The biggest disadvantages to refactoring code is time and money. When working through deadline and on a budget, there may not always be time to make code more "pretty". However, refactoring a code we can increase its efficency and decrease the chance of errors. A refactored code can keep a code up-to-date and easier for teams working together to correct errors.

- Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Stock-Analysis Code
    - Advantages
        - The code ran more efficently. 
        - Due to the efficency it will be able to run larger data sets with more ease. 
    - Disadvantages
        - The time that it took to refactor the code that did not have any errors seemed redundent.
